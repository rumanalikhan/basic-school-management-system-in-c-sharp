# School Management System

## Overview
This School Management System is a command-line application. The system allows both teachers and students to interact with a basic set of functionalities such as enrollment, updating details, viewing marks and grades, marking attendance, and more. The system uses text files to store student and teacher information, attendance records, marks, and grades.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into a single C# file (`Program.cs`) containing the main program logic. The functionalities are divided into methods, providing a modular structure for easy maintenance and understanding.

## How to Use
1. **Login**: The program begins with a login prompt, allowing users to log in as a teacher or a student. New students can also enroll in the system.

2. **Teacher Menu**: Teachers have access to options such as viewing students, marking attendance, grading, and more. Each option is presented in a clear menu format.

3. **Student Menu**: Students can check their details, update information, view marks, grades, and attendance. The student menu is designed for easy navigation.

4. **File Handling**: The program uses text files (`Slist.txt`, `Tlist.txt`, `Attendence.txt`, `Marks.txt`, `Grades.txt`) to store and retrieve information. The file handling methods ensure data persistence.

## Instructions for Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the program using a C# compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the menus and interact with the system.
